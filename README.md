# 🏋️ Athlete Performance & Injury Prediction Platform

This project is a modular web-based platform designed to help coaches, teams, and athletes monitor performance, assess injury risk, and receive personalized training recommendations using machine learning.

## 🚀 Phase 1 Overview (MVP)

Includes:
- Web dashboard for coaches and admins
- Athlete data input and management
- Machine Learning predictions:
  - Injury severity prediction
  - Performance classification
  - Recovery success
  - Periodization recommendation logic
- API-based architecture for future mobile extension

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI or Flask)
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
- **DB:** SQLite (for MVP) → Postgres (recommended for production)
- **ML Libraries:** XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Testing:** Pytest

---

## 🧠 ML Models (v1)

- `injury_model.pkl`: Predicts injury severity
- `performance_model.pkl`: Classifies performance outcome
- `predictor.py`: Unified interface for loading models and generating results

> ✅ Future enhancements will include model retraining, accuracy improvements, and real-time feedback via user data.

## 🧪 Sample API Input/Output

**Input:**
```json
{
  "heart_rate": 70,
  "poms_score": 15,
  "confidence_score": 0.8,
  "training_type": "Cardio",
  "...": "..."
}
````

**Output:**

```json
{
  "injury_severity_prediction": "Mild",
  "performance_class": 2,
  "recovery_success_prediction": 1,
  "periodization_recommendation": "Peak phase"
}
```
